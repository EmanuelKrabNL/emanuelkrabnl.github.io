# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is currently maintained and updated regularly. All versions on the `main` branch are supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue or vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it **privately** by contacting me via:

- GitHub Issues with `[SECURITY]` in the title **(for minor things)**
- Or, reach out via my GitHub profile: [@EmanuelKrabNL](https://github.com/EmanuelKrabNL)

I will respond as soon as possible to assess and address the issue.

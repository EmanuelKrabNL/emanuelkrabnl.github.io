## Who Is This For?

This repo is intended to showcase my work and MIT journey. Contributions are welcome for:

- Fixing bugs in layouts or configuration  
- Improving documentation (README, this file, etc.)  
- Adding or updating blog posts in `_posts/`  
- Adding new projects or tools under `_data/projects.yml` or `_tools/`  
- Suggesting improvements for accessibility, performance, or SEO

## Reporting Issues

- Search existing issues before opening a new one.  
- Use clear titles and descriptions:  
  - **What** is the problem?  
  - **How** can it be reproduced?  
  - Include screenshots, logs, or error messages if available.

## Pull Requests

1. **Fork** this repository and create a branch named for your change, e.g. `fix-footer` or `add-yt-dlp-ui`.  
2. Make your changes in that branch.  
3. **Test locally** to ensure everything works and looks correct.  
4. Push your branch to your fork, then open a PR against `main` here.  
5. In your PR description, explain **what** you changed and **why**, linking to any related issues.  
6. Iâ€™ll review within a few daysâ€”feel free to remind me if you donâ€™t hear back.

## Code Style

- **Markdown**: Use ATX headers (`#`, `##`), 2â€‘space indentation, wrap lines at ~80 characters.  
- **YAML**: 2 spaces per indent, no tabs, minimal quoting.  
- **HTML**: Well-formed tags, alphabetical attribute order.  
- **JavaScript/CSS** (in `assets/` or `_tools/`):  
  - Use ES6+ (`const`, arrow functions, modules).  
  - Follow [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for consistency.
